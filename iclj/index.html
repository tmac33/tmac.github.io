<h3 id="teamwork-and-management">Teamwork and management</h3>

<p>In project management course, Our team needs to incubate an innovation project, the electronic specification project.I think it will be easy because it is our strong point. But I found myself overly optimistic until the teacher asked me to submit the first version of the document. In the past, the company has very perfect project process management method, it can always complete the release on time. However, when it was my turn to take charge of the project, I completely confused the team management, which was manifested in inefficient collaboration, communication barriers, task delay and declining project delivery quality.I am not a team player, so I had the intention to give up. But when everyone sat down calmly and reviewed the plan, I found that team management was a very important thing.</p>

<h3 id="the-educational-difference-between-nz-and-chn">The educational difference between NZ and CHN</h3>

<p>The composition of study time is the biggest difference between western and Chinese education systems. For example, in the undergraduate study, the learning time of a course is 20 hours per week, which may mean that the teacher&rsquo;s lecture time will reach 20 hours. The teacher will tell you that you have a complete understanding of the course system and content, so as to ensure that students&rsquo; learning level is meet. In contrast, for a course of western education, the teacher may only talk for 2 hours, and the remaining 18 hours require students to master the system and structure of knowledge by themselves, which requires a high level of autonomy in learning.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-give-a-presentation-in-english">How to give a presentation in english</h3>

<p>I have given many lectures in Chinese, including at least five technology sharing sessions with more than 500 people.However, the English speech is indeed a mess. I have summed it up with two points. First, the English level is limited and cannot reach the desired level.Second, attitude. When I saw people who were not as good as me in English but got higher scores than me in the speech, I realized that it was my attitude that made me fail. if I to do more exercises like my earnest classmates, I must win.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-incubate-an-innovation-program">How do you incubate an innovation program</h3>

<p>Project incubation is a complex system that involves innovation, management, collaboration, marketing, communication, etc. Specific to each employee generally only responsible for their own specific part.The factors that influence the innovation of enterprises are internal and external. How to do a good job in the cultivation of enterprise innovation is the first point learned. There are three levels of innovation: incremental, semi radical, and radical. Different costs paid by different enterprises have different impacts on the fate of enterprises, which is reflected in PTW/PNTL.
How to make innovation happen in your company is a lively course.</p>

<h3 id="learned-from-classmates-professors">Learned from classmates &amp; professors</h3>

<p>I am a confident person and don&rsquo;t see the good in others. Trusting Only Myself. But when a simple team work cannot be completed and faces failure, I learn from my classmates that ability only determines part of the success of an event, and there are more important parts than ability, which are hidden in teammates, you need to discover them. The teacher may only teach you a few hours of knowledge a week, but outside the classroom, when you write your own paper, the knowledge system of the reorganization, let you understand the true meaning of education.
Appreciate their effort.</p>

<h2 id="a-reflective-approach-to-me">a reflective approach to me</h2>

<p><img src="/img/reflectmodel.PNG" alt="reflectiveapproach" /></p>

<h3 id="a-concrete-experience">A concrete experience</h3>

<p>When I am getting a research topic，
I am eager to answer the following questions: who, what,
where, when, why and how. If i adopt this approach, the first four
questions will help me sort out what happened and the final two
questions will help with the next stage of reflection.</p>

<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>

<p>At this
stage we are interested in finding out what the really significant
actions and words were and we will be answering the questions ‘why’
and ‘how’ did these things happen.</p>

<h3 id="generalisation">Generalisation</h3>

<p>The key question that I will want to answer here is ‘so
what?’ In going through the concrete experience and reflection stages
I have, in effect, revealed ‘what’ happened, so now I need to
work out what should be the impact of those events on my future
actions.</p>

<h3 id="action">Action</h3>

<p>There are just two questions that i need to ask myself as i take
action:
l. What do I want and what do I think I can achieve?
2. How will I know that I’m on the way?</p>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>

<p><img src="/img/feedback.jpg" alt="feedbackfromclassment" /></p>

<p>And obviously, this is an interesting list, because all of the ratings are positive.So I appreciate everyone&rsquo;s honesty.
To a large extent, what determines a person is his shortcoming. Through one semester of MBI study, I have realized that my biggest gain is to find the lack of management ability. Therefore, I hope that I will be more and more perfect through the future study and getting along with everyone.</p>
